<h1 align="center">Jungle Memory Game</h1>

<!-- [View the live project here.](https://github.com/danielj314/project-one) -->

This is a memory card game designed for children. The aim of the game is to turn over all of the matching pairs of cards before the timer runs down to zero. 

The site is built using html CSS and JavaScript.

  - This section will allow the user to play the card game. The cards are spaced out evenly.Each card in the grid is clear for the player to see at different screen sizes.
  - The images selected for the front faces of the cards are brightly coloured and easily distinguishable from one another.
  - The back of the cards have a more neutral colour in order to ensure that they are easily distignuishable from the animals on the front of the cards.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future a score may be provided in order to show the user how many turns it took them to complete the game.

- An easy, medium and hard version could be added which either adds more cards to the grid or reduces the time allowed to complete the game.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

### Content 

- Instructions on how to create the javascript code for the game area was taken from [Memory Card Game JavaScript Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZniVgo8U7ek). This specifically included the code used to flip the cards, to recognise whether or not the cards matched and how to keep the matching cards turned over or to reset non-matching pairs.

- The css used to create the modals are created using bootstrap templates from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/).
